# Apache Error Pages Replacement

The Apache Error Pages project is a drop-in replacement of beautifully designed, user-friendly Apache 2 error pages. If you're tired of having _boring_ Apache error pages displayed to users then these might just be the solution for you.

## Features

- Fully responsive templates, works across desktop, tablet and mobile phones.
- Animated text, creating the illusion of an error output on a Terminal console.
- There are 24 templates covering all Apache 2 error statuses. Enjoy!
- Font Awesome icons used in error messages.

Installation instructions are found below the previews. This shouldn't take you more than 5-10 minutes to implement these crafted, custom-designed Apache error pages.
